Machine Learning Coursework and Practice Problems

Author: Hunter Carroll

---

This repo contains my work, written and coding solutions from the CU Denver course in Machine Learning Methods. This repo will also contain my worked solutions from Numerical Linear Algebra and Matrix Methods at California State University, Long Beach. Along with some general machine learning projects that I have led on my own.
