# Machine Learning Coursework and Practice Problems

Author: Hunter Carroll

This repository showcases a combination of **theoretical foundations** and **hands-on implementations** in machine learning, completed as part of the **[CU Denver – Machine Learning Methods](https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/Machine-Learning-Methods)** course. The work emphasizes practical model development using Python and standard ML libraries.

## Machine Learning Exercises

This section contains end-to-end programming assignments implementing core machine learning algorithms, including data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

1. **Linear Regression with Gradient Descent**  
   `linear-regression_gradient-descent_food-truck.ipynb`  
   Built a univariate linear regression model from scratch, visualized training data, implemented the cost function, and optimized parameters using gradient descent to predict business profit.

2. **Support Vector Machines (Linear and Kernel-Based)**  
   `support-vector-machines_linear-vs-kernel_C-regularization.ipynb`  
   Trained and compared linear SVMs with varying regularization strengths and implemented an RBF-kernel SVM to handle nonlinear decision boundaries.

3. **Decision Trees and Random Forests**  
   `decision-trees_random-forest_letter-classification.ipynb`  
   Performed supervised classification on the Letter Recognition (C vs. G) dataset, comparing single decision trees with ensemble-based random forests.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction and Classification (PCA + SVM)**  
   `pca_svm_mnist_hyperparameter-search.ipynb`  
   Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality of the MNIST dataset and trained an SVM classifier using pipelines and hyperparameter search for performance optimization.

5. **Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering**  
   `kmeans_clustering_image-segmentation_elbow-method.ipynb`  
   Implemented K-means clustering for image segmentation, selected the number of clusters using the elbow method, and visualized clustering results.
